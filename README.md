Project that offers 2 migration tools from the legacy applications to the new ones.

## `migration2server`

This tool will allow the migration of the blockchain from the legacy node format to the `NosoServer` one.

## `migration2wallet`

At present moment this idea is still very fluid and will depend on decisions made after the `NosoServer` is completed.

## Support for Windows and macOS

This appears to be possible, from some Internet searches( Windows ) and the results of the compilation under macOS.

I will not pursue it myself and will leave it to the more competent programmers to sort it out if they really need support for Windows and macOS.
