Project that offers 2 migration tools from the legacy applications to the new ones.

## `migration2server`

This tool will allow the migration of the blockchain from the legacy node format to the `NosoServer` one.

## `migration2wallet`

At present moment this idea is still very fluid and will depend on decisions made after the `NosoServer` is completed.
